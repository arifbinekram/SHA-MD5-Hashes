# SHA-MD5 Hashes

This project is a simple Python script designed to generate hash values for a given input string using various hashing algorithms, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. Hashing is a crucial technique in computer security, used for data integrity checks and secure password storage.

## Features

- **MD5 Hash:** Generates a 128-bit hash value, commonly used for checksums.
- **SHA1 Hash:** Produces a 160-bit hash value, often used for data verification.
- **SHA256 Hash:** Generates a 256-bit hash value, providing stronger security.
- **SHA512 Hash:** Produces a 512-bit hash value, offering the highest level of security in the SHA family.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arifbinekram/SHA-MD5-Hashes.git
   cd SHA-MD5-Hashes
   ```

2. **Ensure you have Python 3 installed:**

   You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_generator.py
   ```

2. **Enter the string when prompted:**

   The script will ask for an input string. Provide the string you want to hash.

3. **View the hash values:**

   The script will display the MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 hash values for the input string.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the string you would like to hash: hello
MD5 Hash = 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
SHA1 Hash = aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
SHA256 Hash = 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
SHA512 Hash = 9b71d224bd62f3785d96d46ad3ea3d73319bfbcfdb49506624f9e8f00e0518f0a8fbbd4aca35fe8c341da41e465ee1bdac1232e2f3c89c5e6a8f04369b49c1c
End of list.
